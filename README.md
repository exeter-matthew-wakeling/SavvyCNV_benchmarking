Additional files for benchmarking of CNV callers

This repository holds files used for the benchmarking of CNV callers.

## AnalyseCnvs

This is a java program used to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of CNV calling, given a truth set, CNV caller results, and a list of common CNVs. The software can find the optimum filtering parameters for CNVs in the results to produce the maximum true calls and the minimum false calls. The command-line arguments are:
1. -decon - The CNV caller results file is expected to be in the format produced by DeCoN. The file is expected to be a tab-separated file with the sample name in column 2, the chromosome in column 11, the start position in column 9, the end position in column 10, and either "deletion" or "duplication" in column 7. Recommended optimisation arguments are "-optimise 8 -optimise 13 -optimise 0", which correspond to the number of active bins in the CNV, the Bayes Factor, and the Bayes Factor divided by the CNV size.
2. -cnvkit - The CNV caller results file is expected to be in the format produced by CnvKit. The file is expected to be a tab-separated file with the sample name in column 1, the chromosome in column 2, the start position in column 3, the end position in column 4, and the log read depth anomaly in column 6. Recommended optimisation arguments are "-optimise 9 -optimise 10 -optimise 0", which correspond to the number of active bins, the quality score, and the quality score divided by the CNV size.
3. -excavator2 - The CNV caller results file is expected to be in the format produced by Excavator2. The file is expected to be a tab-separated file with the sample name in column 1, the chromosome in column 2, the start position in column 3, the end position in column 4, and the log read depth anomaly in column 5. Recommended optimisation arguments are "-optimise 9 -optimise 0", which correspond to the CNV probability, and the CNV size.
4. -copywriter - the CNV caller results file is expected to be in the format produced by CopywriteR. The file is expected to be a tab-separated file with the sample name in column 1, the chromosome in column 2, the start position in column 3, the end position in column 4, and either "Deletion" or "Duplication" in column 5. Recommended optimisation arguments are "-optimise 6 -optimise 9 -optimise 10", which correspond to the number of active bins, the absolute value of the log read depth anomaly, and the absolute value of the log read depth anomaly multiplied by the active bin count.
5. -truth - Specifies the location of the truth set. This is a file listing the CNVs that are truly present, as determined by another method, in the same format as the truth set for the ICR96 data set. The file is expected to be a tab-separated file with the sample name in column 1, the chromosome in column 8, the start position in column 9, the end position in column 10, and "Deletion" or "Duplication" in column 6.
